            In September 2014, Santos King organized a National level Cyclothon
            of 90 km in the unexplored virgin serenity of Sabarimala. The event
            "AICA Tour De Kerala" Mountain Challenge: Sabarimala, powered by
            FUJI bikes turned out to be a huge success story with the
            participation of 108 riders from across the country. In January
            2018, we organized a one-of-a-kind Sunset Beach Run - "Joanns Kochi
            Duskathon, Powered by Mahindra" in Kuzhuppilly Beach, Kerala which
            attracted 1200+ runners. The second edition of the event was
            organized in April 2019 - "Kochi Duskathon - World's Largest
            Barefoot Race" with a large number of barefoot runners participating
            in the event. In 2021, we continued with the trend and organized
            "Paddlers Meetup - River Periyar Cleanup" in Aluva on the occasion
            of World Tourism Day with the apt theme of "Unity - Lets Grow
            Together". Our latest event 'Kochi Swimathon 2022', South India's
            first River Swimathon held in River Periyar, Aluva Kochi was a huge
            success.
