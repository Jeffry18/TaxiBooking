- Field selection to minimize data transfer
- Location validation to improve relevance
- Fallback options for poor connectivity

### Monitoring
- Track API usage in Google Cloud Console
- Monitor quotas and billing
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Request denied"**: Check API key and billing

3. **Slow responses**: Check network and API quotas
4. **Invalid locations**: Location validation in place
